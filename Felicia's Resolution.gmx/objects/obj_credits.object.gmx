    Music: Frédéric Chopin's Ballade no. 1 in G minor, Op. 23 preformed by Frank Levy.
    People with ADD or ADHD may have a hard time keeping track of quests they have available, completed, and the outcome of those quests. I have added a pause menu that adds quests as the player talks to NPC and shows if it was completed with a good or bad marking to match their decisions.
    No features need to be enabled or disabled; they all add to the game experience as is.
    This game has co=operation with NPCs, exploration with an open world to find people and quests, characters and a story with each NPC having a quest and an overall story which concludes based on your decisions in game, and everyday setting with a simple town but with a fantasy twist, socilizing with NPCs, casual communication with the tutorial, pop-up info, and the dialogue, conflict resolution but allowing the player to make peaceful or aggressive resolutions for each quest, a social significance solution by helping everyone in town and gaining their favor or distrust, landmark navigation, and alternate rewards and punishment by giving the player favor or distrust from NPC's depending on the player's actions.");
